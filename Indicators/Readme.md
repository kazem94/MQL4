this indicator, on chart, you add RSI and MACD with default values and then add tis indicator.
so you see Divergence and Convergence on Chart, RSI and MACD.
4 types of Divergence and Convergence checked via this indicator.
4 types are Regular (+/-) and Hidden (+/-).
be honest with me and send me all your ideas about this indicator that i can improve this.
thank you
